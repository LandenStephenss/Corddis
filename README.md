# Corddis
A really cool Discord library

Corddis provides a low-level, object-oriented interface for the Discord bot API.

Corddis's goals in no particular order:
* Stay minimal to Discord's API
* Allows end users to have as much control as possible over their application
* Do all the hard work. All the end user has to do is make the bot
